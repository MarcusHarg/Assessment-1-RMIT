# Assessment-1-RMIT
Personal Info
My name is Marcus Hargreaves, RMIT student number s3735636, s3735636@student.rmit.edu.au. Born and raised in Australia in a christian family. Completed year 12 in 2015 and have been working at a financial planning firm since 2017. 
My first year of local senior footy is the year Brendan Fevola came to my home town and played for us. He was here for 3 years. I also have a 10 month old Samoyed puppy named Jax.

Interest in IT:
My interest in IT isn't a major part in why I chose to do this course. I have grown up with IT surrounding me from a yound age and therefore know my way around the basic computers and phones however have never delved any deeper into how everything works. I recently became interested in gaming PC's and how they are put together but have yet to get hands on with anything of the kind. I have close to no IT experience, however in my job we use excel spreadsheets daily, as well as outlook functions and things, so I have some general knowledge about how things work. I cam to RMIT because they were able to give me the opportunity to work through Open Universities Australia and study whilst working full time as well as everything else going on in my life. They give you the flexibility to be able to watch lectures or do things at home online whenever it is convenient to you. From this subject I expect to get a greater understanding of technologies in the world and how they affect everyday life and how they may affect life in the future as well.
